1. A blockchain is a storage system in the form of a chain to make it secure. It is secure because each block in the chain references the previous block and it is stored across many networks making it very difficult to disrupt. 
2. A smart contract allows parties to make an exchange on a blockchain by creating rules for each party to complete for the transaction to execute. 
3. A transaction is an exchange of some sort and has a cost associated. A script allows you to view something on the blockchain, it does not change it or cost to view.
