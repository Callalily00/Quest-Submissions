1. In words, list 3 reasons why structs are different from resources. 
    Resources are more secure than structs. Resources cannot be copied, where structs can.  Resources are harder to create or deal with, than structs.

2. Describe a situation where a resource might be better to use than a struct.  
   Resources are secure and difficult to lose, so it would be better to use when creating an NFT.

3. What is the keyword to make a new resource?  
    Wouldn't it be resource?  i.e. pub resource Greeting {
    
4. Can a resource be created in a script or transaction (assuming there isn't a public function to create one)?
    A script is used to view something so I would say no, we cannot create a resource here.  A transaction is just that, so I would think you can create a resource here.
   
5. What is the type of the resource below?
    This is a secure container of information named Jacob. 
    
6. Let's play the "I Spy" game from when we were kids. I Spy 4 things wrong with this code. Please fix them.

    pub fun createJacob(): @Jacob { 
        let myJacob <- create Jacob() 
        return <- myJacob
