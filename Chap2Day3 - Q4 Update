Updated response to Q4

4.  a. What the error message means - Expected String, got String?.  The program is expecting a ? becuase there is a dictionary, it is expecting an optional
    b. Why we're getting this error - Because we are trying to return information from a dictionary.  We are checking to see if the value we are asking it to return, is one of the values listed.  Using a ? (optional) indicator, this will remove the error and return the request.  
    Thank you for explaining the force unwrap operator !.  I tried it again today and it worked.  It wasn't working for me so I thought it was my error but seems it was the playground.  This basically tells the program to just do it or panic if it is not there.
    c. How to fix it - add a ? after string on line 1
      pub fun main(): String? {
      OR
      return thing[0x03]!
