What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars? safety and security, clarity, approachability, developer experience and resource oriented programming
In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?   To me, who has no experience with coding or other programs, it sounds like Cadence is an improvement to other programs.  It was made similar so it can be easy to understand for someone who has worked with other programs. It improves security, easier for a user to read, and easier to debug when receiving errors.
