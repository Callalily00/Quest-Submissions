  changeGreeting is a request to change something so would be executed as a transaction  Script is for viewing, not changing.

What does the AuthAccount mean in the prepare phase of the transaction?
  This is to receive suthorization from owner of the transaction  It is a "sign off" of the requested transaction.

What is the difference between the prepare phase and the execute phase in the transaction?
  The prepare phase is where you can request permission for the transaction. The execute is where to request the changes to be made.

Add two new things inside your contract:

A variable named myNumber that has type Int (set it to 0 when the contract is deployed)
A function named updateMyNumber that takes in a new number named newNumber as a parameter that has type Int and updates myNumber to be newNumber
  See pic labeled Chap2Day2.pic1 - I struggled with this one and had to look to others on the discord to complete this one.
  
Add a script that reads myNumber from the contract
  See pic labeled Chap2Day2.pic2 - I was able to get this one!

Add a transaction that takes in a parameter named myNewNumber and passes it into the updateMyNumber function. Verify that your number changed by running the script again.
  See pics labeled Chap2Day2.pic3 and Chap2Day2.pic4 - Was also able to get this one.
